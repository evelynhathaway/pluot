# Pluot

**Create iCal files from Wild Apricot events**

[![license: MIT](https://badgen.net/badge/license/MIT/blue)](/LICENSE)

</div>

## Description

Pluot queries events from Wild Apricot's API and outputs an iCal calendar to share.

It isn't complete and shouldn't be used in production, but it's a great place to start if [their Integromat script](https://www.integromat.com/en/integration/2276-copy-wild-apricot-events-into-google-calendar) doesn't work for you. Pluot has many benefits over the equally not-production-ready Integromat script.

## Install

You can install Pluot by cloning the repository locally and then installing the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evelynhathaway/pluot.git
cd pluot
npm install
```
